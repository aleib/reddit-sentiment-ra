And on that note, is arguably one of the most secure browsers out there currently.</p>\n\n<p>Firefox built it's popularity on customization and being open source.</p>\n\n<p>Opera had the power user market for a while. And that's what Vivaldi's aiming for.</p>\n\n<p>Microsoft needs to figure out what it wants to do with Edge, and make it work for that market.</p>\n\n<p>I guess by coupling in cortana and note taking features they're aiming for the average user, but edge feels less customizable and user friendly then Chrome.

            "body": "There's a few changes between IE and edge.\n\nFor starters, Edge is a modern app, and uses a forked version of IE's rendering engine with backwards compatibility mostly removed. Edge doesn't even support ActiveX. Aside from flash which is now built into windows.\n\nEdge is supposed to get browser extensions \"eventually\"\n\nNot completely relevant, but Microsoft also open sourced Edge's javascript renderer, presumably so they could couple it with node.js in Windows 10 for IOT.\n\nI think the Biggest problem with microsoft edge isn't the name change, it's that they haven't really hit a stride with it yet.\n\nChrome has extensions, and basically became the appstore of browsers. And on that note, is arguably one of the most secure browsers out there currently.\n\nFirefox built it's popularity on customization and being open source.\n\nOpera had the power user market for a while. And that's what Vivaldi's aiming for.\n\nMicrosoft needs to figure out what it wants to do with Edge, and make it work for that market.\n\nI guess by coupling in cortana and note taking features they're aiming for the average user, but edge feels less customizable and user friendly then Chrome. MS add extensions, and maybe allow the user to integrate the windows theme with the browser.\n\n\n\n",
